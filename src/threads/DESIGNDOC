Added to struct thread:

    int64_t ticks_when_awake;          /* Timer ticks count when awakened. */
    struct list_elem sleepelem;        /* List element for sleeping list. */
    struct semaphore sleepsema;        /* Semaphore to make a thread sleep
                                          and wake it up. */
    struct semaphore priority_sema;    /* Semaphore to control access to 
                                          donated priorities */


---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe what happens in a call to timer_sleep(),
>> including the effects of the timer interrupt handler.

All that timer_sleep() does is make sure that interrupts are enabled, then
call thread_sleep(). The value passed to thread_sleep() specifies on (or
after) which tick the timer can be woken up. (The given value will be checked
before schedule() chooses another thread to run).
Similarly, the timer interrupt handler simply increments 'ticks', then calls
thread_tick(). This will ncrement the appropriate one of 'idle_ticks',
'user_ticks', or 'kernel_ticks', as before. The only change we have made is
that it will also implement the BSD scheduler correctly.


>> A3: What steps are taken to minimize the amount of time spent in
>> the timer interrupt handler?

Rather than check the sleeping threads on every tick, to see if they should be
woken up, we only check them when schedule() is called. (The only change made
to the calling of the interrupt handler is the implementation of the BSD
scheduler).


---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: How are race conditions avoided when multiple threads call
>> timer_sleep() simultaneously?

//TODO: this question
There are no race conditions when timer_sleep() is called, because
thread_sleep() makes sure the only the current thread is calling it?
IUNNOLOL :D


>> A5: How are race conditions avoided when a timer interrupt occurs
>> during a call to timer_sleep()?

//TODO: also this question
They... aren't? I mean, it looks to me as though the number of ticks 'til the
thread wakes up could go either way (that is, if the interrupt occurs before
or after the call to thread_sleep()).


---- RATIONALE ----

>> A6: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We chose this design to try to minimise the amont of time in interrupts. For
example, we only wake sleeping threads when schedule() is called, and don't
bother to check them on every tick.

Added to struct thread:

                                          via donation. */
    struct lock *blockinglock;         /* Lock causing the thread to block. */

                                          condition */

New struct:

struct donated_priority
  {
    struct lock *blocking_lock;     /* The lock causing priority to be 
                                       donated. */
    int priority;                   /* The priority donated. */
    struct list_elem priority_elem; /* Element in a thread's donated
                                       priority list.*/
  };


>> B2: Explain the data structure used to track priority donation.
>> Use ASCII art to diagram a nested donation.  (Alternately, submit a
>> .png file.)

The tracking system for priority donation only allows for threads to be
tracked that need to be donated to, there is no way of knowing where
a donation has come from from the receiving thread's point of view,
because it does not need to know.

When trying to track down threads a thread needs to donate to, it simply
looks at the blocking_lock (the lock that is causing the thread to block),
it then can see which thread it needs to donate to by the holder field in
the lock struct. When the receiving thread gets this new priority, it can
apply the same principles to track down the thread it needs to pass on the
donation to if need be.

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: How do you ensure that the highest priority thread waiting for
>> a lock, semaphore, or condition variable wakes up first?

Within both semaphores and condition variables, the waiting thread with the
highest priority is simply found from the list each time (using the
has_lower_priority() function). For conditions, this involved adding a
pointer to the thread in each semaphore_elem, in order to find the correct
priority.


>> B4: Describe the sequence of events when a call to lock_acquire()
>> causes a priority donation.  How is nested donation handled?

First, the lock will try to be acquired with sema_try_down(), as not
to immediately block if it fails. When sema_try_down() returns false, the
blocking_lock field of the current thread is set to a pointer of the
lock trying to be acquired. The procedure thread_donate_priority() is then
called, with the current thread as its argument.

In thread_donate_priority(), the procedure will immediately return if 
there is no lock blocking the thread (base case of recursive call). The 
thread recieving donation is then found as the blocking_lock's holder.
The next task is to traverse the donated_priorities list in the recieving
thread, if a priority has been donated for the same lock and it is smaller
than the current thread's priority, then the priority is set to that of
the current thread. If the priority is greater than the current thread then
the function returns, as there is no point donating a lower priority for the
same lock.

If no priority has been donated for this lock, then a new donated_priority
struct is malloced and inserted into the ordered list of donated priorities
for the recieving thread. The list is ordered by priority and is kept
in descending order.

thread_choose_priority is then called on the receiving thread. This function 
basically compares the values of the priority set by the thread, and the head
of the donated priorities list, and then sets the priority field to whichever 
is highest.

thread_donate_priority() is now called again on the receiving thread, which
gives it the chance to donate if nested donation is required. After this 
the function exits.

Finally, sema_down() is called and the thread waits for the lock to be
released.

>> B5: Describe the sequence of events when lock_release() is called
>> on a lock that a higher-priority thread is waiting for.

The holder field of the lock is set to NULL, and thread_remove_priority()
is called with the current thread and lock as parameters. This simply 
removes the donated_priority struct associated with the lock from the
thread's donated_priorities list, and free's the memory.
thread_choose_priority() is then called to update the thread's priority,
sema_up() is finally called to release the lock.

>> B6: Describe a potential race in thread_set_priority() and explain
>> how your implementation avoids it.  Can you use a lock to avoid

//TODO: yeah, I still have no idea about these race conditions


---- RATIONALE ----

>> B7: Why did you choose this design?  In what ways is it superior to
>> another design you considered?

We considered storing the list of threads waiting on the synchronisation
primitives in order of priority. However, this would have meant adding
more code and storing more data when the priority of a thread changes.

As far as priority donation is concerned, it soon became clear that a
list of donated priorities would be needed to handle multiple donation,
with a seperate variable to allow the thread's directly set priority to
be preserved.

An option considered was that the priority_donation structs would contain
pointers to the thread's that the priorities should be stored in a hash table
opposed to a list, to allow values to be removed in constant time. But the 
benefit of using an ordered list instead was that the highest priority could
be accessed from the head of the list, an ordered hashtable would have to
be written to accomplish this. It was then decided that given the small number
of priorities likely to be donated, this approach would be slower in practice
than the ordered list, even if it had better time complexity.

It was also discussed that the priority field should be removed from the
thread struct, and there should be a get_priority() function to return
either the set priority, or the head of the donated priorities. But it was
decided that the priority of a thread was going to be required to be
calculated too often with this method, and it would be better to call a
method to set the field, which became thread_choose_priority().

Additionally, a semaphore had to be used instead of a lock to control access
to priority_donations (priority_sema). This is because the lock would have 
had to be released indirectly from lock_release(), resulting in an infinite 
loop.
